# pandas_libs

This code is a Pandas library study with a data analysis on a fictional retail sector. The purpose of this is personal, just to upgrade my pandas skills.
In this code I use:
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - plotly (graph_objects and express)
  - cufflinks
  - chart-studio

In this code I use 2 datasets: 
  -  varejo.xlsx
  -  cliente_varejo.xlsx

I first did some data cleaning and preparation before the analysis, looking for null values and exchanging some values containing blank spaces for underscore/underline. I also did a info search for data that were not in the same category like "APP" and "Aplicativo", which are the same thing, so I replaced the caregory name to not have any doubled category.

I did a little treat on column names, replacing blanks for underscore/underline.
